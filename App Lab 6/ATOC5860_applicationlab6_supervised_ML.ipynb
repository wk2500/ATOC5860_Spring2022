    "## STEP 2: Data and Function Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "Data preparation is a huge part of building Machine Learning model \"pipelines\". Carefully think through building & training a Machine Learning model before you run it. There are a few statistical \"gotchas\" that may result in your model being biased, inaccurate, or not suitable for the problem at hand.  Address these 6 questions!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q1: What exactly are we trying to predict? A value, an outcome, a category?** Define your predictors and predictand. Relate these to your hypothesis or overarching question. In our case, our predictand is the likelihood of precipitation. We will build models to predict the likelihood that it's currently precipitating, given current atmospheric conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2: Do you have any missing data? If so, how will you handle them?** Keep in mind, decreasing the number of input observations may bias your model. Using the Christman dataset, we have no missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3: Do you have any categorical or non-numeric variables or features?** If so, you must figure out how to encode them into numbers. Luckily, in the geosciences, we rarely run into this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4: How will we validate our model?** Typically, people split their existing data into training data and testing data, or perform \"cross-validation\" or a \"test-train split\". That is, we will \"hold out\" some data and call it our \"testing data\", while using the rest of the data to train our model (i.e., \"training data\"). Once our model is trained, we will evaluate its performance with the holdout testing data. Note: This could be problematic if there is limited data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q5: Do your features have the same variance?** You need to consider this to ensure your model doesn't overly depend on one variable with large variance. This step is called \"feature scaling\". Features of the same size also speed up the Gradient Descent algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q6: If classification is the goal, are there the same number of observations for each feature and outcome? If not, how will you rebalance?** Here, the Christman dataset has same number of observations (8784) for each feature. But, times with no precipitation are way more common than times with precipitation. To deal with this issue, we will oversample the observations associated with precip so that the two outcomes (or \"classes\") are equal. Note: It's important that feature scaling or normalization is performed before any rebalancing so that the qualitative statistics (mean, stddev, etc) remain the same.\n",

    "**Q7: Which metrics are appropriate for assessing your model?** Consider the bias-variance trade-off, and whether having false positives or false negatives is more impactful. In our case, predicting no rain when there is rain (false negative) is probably more frustrating and potentially more impactful than the other way around (a false positive)."

We begin by first assessing each model's performance by calculating the metrics defined above on the *testing* or *holdout* data; the key here is that the model has never seen this data. <br>__If applicable, tune your model.__ This means choosing new *hyperparameters*, retraining the model, and then reassessing the same model metrics to see if the model yields better results.\n",
    "3. __Check for model overfitting__. We will also check to see if the model is overfitting by comparing metrics of the testing data to that of the training data. In short, the training data should not be outperforming the testing data.\n",
    "4. __Actually make a prediction with a single observation__. Predicted precipitation probability provides a sanity test for us to make sure the model isn't way off base. It allows us to see for ourselves: given X meteorological conditions and our own understanding of meteorology, would rain seem likely? Is the model actually doing something realistic?"

A symptom of overfitting is that the models' training accuracy is much better than the testing accuracy. Overfitting can happen more easily in more complex models, like neural networks. To alleviate overfitting, one needs to reduce variance, through feature regularization, lowering model complexity, or performing k-folds cross-validation.\n",

A Random Forest is an ensemble of decision trees that are randomly constructed based on the features of the dataset and number of decisions. Trees are constructed by randomly choosing a feature to \"seed\" each tree, and then making rules or associations with other features to lead to the specified outcome."
